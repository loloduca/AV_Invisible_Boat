# Autonomous Vehicle 

This is a hands-on project from our 'Autonomous Robotic Systems' course that focuses on demonstrating fast autonomous navigation in complex environments. We are challenged to complete tasks such as:

	*Lane Detection
	*Wall following and Lane Centering
	*Image & Color Detection for Parking
	*Simultaneous Localization and Mapping


## OpenCV Scripts

Using OpenCV scripts written in Python 2.7, we plan to accomplish these tasks
